          <h2>About this game:</h2>
          <h3>For anyone who's a fan of strategy games, Connect Four is a definite classic. Playing against an opponent, you try to be the first to place four checkers in a row on the game board. While figuring out game winning strategy can sometimes be challenge, the game is simple enough for the entire family to play. If you're gearing up for your first game, you'll get the hang of it in no time, especially if you're familiar with Tic-Tac-Toe.</h3>

          <h2>How to Play:</h2>
          <h3>To win Connect Four, all you have to do is connect four of your colored checker pieces in a row, much the same as tic tac toe. This can be done horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Each player will drop in one checker piece at a time.</h3>
